The ``4-square`` module
=======================

Using ``Square``
---------------

First import ``Square`` from the ``4-square`` module:

      >>> Square = __import__('4-square').Square

Expected Success:
	 # size is int
	 >>> my_square = Square(9)
	 >>> print("Area: {} for size: {}".format(my_square.area(), my_square.size))
	 Area: 81 for size: 9

	 # size is large int
	 >>> my_square = Square(10000000000000000)
	 >>> print("Area: {} for size: {}".format(my_square.area(), my_square.size))
	 Area: 100000000000000000000000000000000 for size: 10000000000000000

	 # no size passed
	 >>> my_square = Square()
	 >>> print("Area: {} for size: {}".format(my_square.area(), my_square.size))
	 Area: 0 for size: 0

Expected Failure:
	 # size is not int
	 >>> my_square = Square("Hello")
	 Traceback (most recent call last):
	 TypeError: size must be an integer

	 # size is negative
	 >>> my_square = Square(-17)
	 Traceback (most recent call last):
	 ValueError: size must be >= 0
